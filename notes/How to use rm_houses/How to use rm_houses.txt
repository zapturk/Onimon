Hello! rm_houses allows you to create many simple rooms without cluttering your MonMae Project with
a ton of GameMaker room assets. Usually when your players is within a room, they are able to see
everything around them.

However, rm_houses has been setup to allow us to put rooms close to, or even directly next to each other
without being able to see into them. This is becuase we have code set up for this room only that blocks
the players view into the other rooms.

To take advantage of this trick, make sure that your RM_HOUSES_GUIDE layer is shown. This gives us an 
outline for how big we can build rooms within this GameMaker room. Every room or houses must fit within
these lines!

If you want to have much bigger, or more complex houses/rooms, please make a new GameMaker room asset
instead, using the DUPLICATE_ME room. There is a lot of information on how to work with rooms and 
tilesets in our MonMae YouTube tutorial series:
