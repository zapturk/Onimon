# HELLO! YANA HERE!
# The format for creating your dialogue is simple. Here's how to do it in 3 steps:

# 1. Type your NPC's UNIQUE number (in MonMae this is referenced as TXT_message) like so: 0
# 2. Add a comma, a space, and the number for this set of messages. First number is the position
#    in the character array (char in character[char]), and the second number is what messages to
#    return to the game, based on what value character[char] holds. (0, 0 is first characters first
#    message, 0, 1 is first characters second message, 1, 0 is second characters first message, etc)

# 3. Type your NPC's messages. One message per line.
# 4. Once you're done adding messages, add a period (.) on a new line to mark the end.

# All done! Please see how NPC number 0's message is formatted below

Hi! I'm a completely different NPC. The NPC above me is NPC number 0, and has 3 sets of messages.
I only have two sets of messages, this is my first one. My second set is numbered 1, 1
I'll move on to my second set of messages after "character[1]" is changed from 0, to 1

Hi! I'm back, looks like you did something important enough in the story to change my message.
Now character[1] is equal to 1! So I'm now returning this set of messages instead of the previous ones.
