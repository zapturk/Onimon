# HELLO! YANA HERE!
# The format for creating your dialogue is simple. Here's how to do it in 3 steps:

# 1. Type your NPC's UNIQUE number like so: 10
# 2. Type your NPC's messages. One message per line.
# 3. Once you're done adding messages, add a period (.) on a new line to mark the end. 

# All done! Please see how NPC number 0's message is formatted below

It's huge, and there's so many things to do.
In my home town, we didn't even have 24/7 restaurants!
