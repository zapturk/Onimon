To add a new move animation, simply add a new sprite / animation and name it "mov_movename"

Make sure the "movename" part is the name of your animation. Your move animation MUST start
with "mov_" to appear as an animation in the moves visual editor.

Default size for moves is currently 56x56px for "animate over" and "projectile" moves.
Default size for "full room" moves is 256x144px.

For the majority of moves, 64x64 should work just fine as is, as may 80x80, however there
may be some overlapping when selecting the move animation from the moves visual editor.

MAKE SURE the move also has the middle-center origin :)
