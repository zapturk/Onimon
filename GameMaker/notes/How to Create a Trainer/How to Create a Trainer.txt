After dragging and dropping a trainer into the room, and selecting their sprite, it's time to assign their team.

Adding monsters to an enemy team is really easy, you simple have to copy and paste a
simple script into the objects CREATION CODE in the room.

To do this, simply double click on the trainer that you just placed into your room, and
select "Creation Code". You can then copy and paste the following into their creation
code to assign this trainers monster team (minimum 1 monster, maximum 6 monsters)

ADD_TRAINER_MONSTER(m.FURREAL, 5);

Replace m.FURREAL with the monster you wish for them to have, and 5 with the level they will be.

To have more monsters, simply add more lines, like so:

ADD_TRAINER_MONSTER(m.FURREAL, 5);
ADD_TRAINER_MONSTER(m.NEKOSWORD, 6);

The "m." is an enumerator, and it's an easy way to keep track of long lists of possible variables.
This is the monsters enumerator, so after you type "m.", you'll see a pop-up containing all of your
monsters names. But, they are currently written with Dokimon's monsters names. You can rename them
from within the "init" script, inside the "init_monsters" function.

For more info about how enumerators work, here's is the GameMaker's documentation on them:
